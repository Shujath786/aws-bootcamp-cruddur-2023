# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework/Tasks

### Install and verify AWS CLI

I did the following steps to install AWS CLI.

I installed the AWS CLI by running the appropriate MSI installer.

The reason I used the MSI installer was because my OS(windows 7) is compatible with AWS CLI Version 1 and there is no option to execute via the command prompt.

I followed the instructions on the [AWS CLI Install Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/install-windows.html)
```
C:\Users\Shujath>aws --version
```
